## Our Investment Strategy: The Quantitative Engine

At the core of StakFi is a sophisticated quantitative engine that actively manages and allocates capital across a spectrum of strategies. This proprietary technology, developed by a team with experience from top-tier quantitative firms, allows us to manage risk and optimize for yield across all market conditions.

Our engine's primary directive is risk management. It operates across five tiers, from the foundational security of **tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills** to the high-growth potential of **early-stage liquidity provisioning**, ensuring the portfolio is always diversified and resilient.
