**StakFi is a quantitative yield protocol that deploys capital through a proprietary Tiered Alpha Engine. We blend institutional-grade risk management with cutting-edge DeFi strategies to deliver optimized, non-custodial yield for every risk appetite.**

Our core philosophy is **Dynamic Risk Parity**. We don't just offer products; we manage a single, unified pool of capital across a spectrum of strategies, from tokenized T-Bills to early-stage liquidity provisioning. Your yield is a direct result of this sophisticated, actively managed engine.

## How It Works: The Five Tiers of Yield

Our engine actively rebalances capital across five distinct tiers, managed 24/7 by our quantitative models.

### üèõÔ∏è Tier 1: Foundation (The Citadel Layer)
*   **Objective:** Absolute capital preservation & baseline yield (Target 4-7% APR).
*   **Strategies:** Tokenized US T-Bills, Delta-Neutral Funding Rate Arbitrage on BTC/ETH.

### üõ°Ô∏è Tier 2: Stabilized Growth (The Nexo Layer)
*   **Objective:** Secure, crypto-native yield from battle-tested protocols (Target 7-12% APR).
*   **Strategies:** Blue-Chip Liquid Staking (e.g., Lido stETH), A-List Stablecoin Lending (Aave, Compound).

### üß† Tier 3: Alpha Seeker (The Quant Layer)
*   **Objective:** Generate alpha through complex, market-neutral strategies (Target 15-40% APR).
*   **Strategies:** Liquid Restaking (EigenLayer), Basis Trading on major altcoins.

### üìà Tier 4: Momentum Rider (The Active Trader Layer)
*   **Objective:** Capitalize on established market trends with managed risk (Target 40-100% APR).
*   **Strategies:** Actively Managed Concentrated Liquidity (Uniswap v3), Narrative-driven yield farms.

### üöÄ Tier 5: Quantum Opportunities (The Venture Layer)
